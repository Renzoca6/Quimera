	    Use this as a brief guideline.

            StoreHandler.AddItem( 'my_second_store', {} ) -- AddItem expects the name of a store, it must be EXACTLY the same as what you
            set inside of npc_config.lua (CASE SENSITIVE)     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   765611980585391085540
            id - This is a number value and MUST be unique, it should NEVER match any other ID. This is VERY important, so please make sure it's not ever the same.
            name - The name shown in the store for this item
            ent - The entity given, if this is not a WEAPON or ENTITY then you do not need to add it.
            model - The model to render in the store.
            colors - The colour of the outline and foreground for this item inside the store.
            description - Text shown when hovering over the item.
            price - The amount of money/points this item costs.
            page - The page that is should appear on. Please make sure the page exists in npc_config.lua for this item.
            properties:
                Now this one might seem a bit complicated, but it's really not.
                    - permanent_item is the item permanent? (Only use for weapons and skins)
                    - type is VERY important, it's how the store knows how to deal with the item on purchase.
                    - Types you can use: Weapon, Entity, Shipment, Rank, Model, Prop. (Shipments ONLY work on DarkRP bases)
                    - main_fov (Field of view) is used to pick how close the item is to the camera in the store, lower = closer, higher = more distant.
                    - can_feature can this item be randomly picked to be featured?
                    - force_set_feature This is used if you don't want a random selection of items, but rather always want the same featured items.
            restricted_to - Usergroups are added here to disallow specific people buying the item.


	    job_restrictions - Use this to restrict via Job Name (Make sure that the name of the Job in-game matches the exact id) Example:
	    job_restrictions = { [ "Hobo" ] = true, [ "Mayor" ] = true }

            Extra information:
                It's important to note that each page can have 2 featured items, so with that in mind:
                    if force_set_feature is true, ensure that the page has 2 items with force_set_feature.
                    You can have as many can_feature items as you want, per page. It'll always pick 2.
                    You can have pages with the same name in different NPCs, no problem.

                    If you are adding a rank, then you MUST add rank = 'user_group_of_choice';
                    (https://gyazo.com/278dbb3f2b0ddecea3a13bdfe14df823) here is what it should look like for a RANK.

                Do not forget your commas if you add to the tables, or you'll fuck up the config and get an error.

	Finally, here is two examples of premade items (ASSUMING Weapons is a valid page):


        StoreHandler.AddItem( 'my_first_store', {
            id = 1,
            name = 'AK47 Redline (New)',
            ent = 'ak47redline',
            model = 'models/weapons/w_cloutak1.mdl',
            colors = { foreground = Color( 255, 77, 77 ), outline = Color( 255, 56, 56 ) },
            description = "It's an AK47 Redline.",
            price = 50000,
            page = 'Weapons',
            properties = { 
                permanent_item = false, type = 'Weapon',
                main_fov = 30, can_feature = false, force_set_feature = false
            }
       } )

       StoreHandler.AddItem( 'my_first_store', {
            id = 2,
            name = 'AK47 Vulcan',
            ent = 'clt_akvlcn',
            model = 'models/weapons/w_vulakclt.mdl',
            colors = { foreground = Color( 56, 146, 172 ), outline = Color( 68, 213, 255 ) },
            description = "It's an AK47 Vulcan.",
            price = 75000,
            page = 'Weapons',
            properties = { 
                permanent_item = true, type = 'Weapon',
                main_fov = 30, can_feature = false, force_set_feature = false
            }
       } )
